Hi! Thanks for being willing to help out!

### Commit Messages

All commit messages should be in command form. As in "add" or "fix", not "adds" or "fixes".

### What to Change

Check the [Issues](https://github.com/Samasaur1/CityManagement/issues) page

### Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) of the form `${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}-${BRANCH_NAME}-b${BUILD_NUMBER}`

### Setting up Your Development Environment

Currently, the only IDE we have full support for is [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (both Community and Ultimate)
